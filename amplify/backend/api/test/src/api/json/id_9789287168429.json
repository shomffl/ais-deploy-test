  "description": "Poverty has become a challenge for European societies. Employment is often considered to be a key route out of poverty, whereas unemployment is seen as a major cause of poverty and social exclusion. Employment does not prevent poverty among the working population, however, and low-income employment has become an important policy issue in Europe. Empowerment of those experiencing extreme poverty in their daily life is one strategy to combat this phenomenon. Empowerment provides individuals living in poverty with the tools which enhance their ability to deal with the situation. This publication is designed to assist policy makers and service providers at national and local levels to develop effective strategies to improve the situation of low-income workers and to empower people experiencing extreme poverty in Europe. it is an important contribution To The implementation of the Council of Europe's Revised Social Cohesion Strategy, As well as To The European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, launched by the European Union in 2010.",
