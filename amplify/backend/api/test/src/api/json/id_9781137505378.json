  "description": "Once the world's largest Official Development Assistance provider, contemporary Japan seems much less visible in international development. However, this edited collection demonstrates that Japan, with its own aid philosophy, experiences, and models of aid, has ample lessons to offer to the international community as the latter seeks new paradigms of development cooperation. Leading thinkers on international development and experienced practitioners both from Japan and worldwide look into the origins, major characteristics and historical changes of development cooperation, investigating its interactions with major partners, including Japan's Asian neighbour countries (particularly China and Korea) and international organizations.",
