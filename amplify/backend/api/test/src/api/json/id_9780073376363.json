  "description": "This edition addresses the increasing global competition and the fact that every industry, business, and service organization is restructuring itself to operate more effectively. Cost-effectiveness and product reliability without excess capacity are the keys to successful activity in business, industry, and government. These keys are the end results of methods engineering. The 13th edition of Methods, Standards, and Work Design will provide practical, up-to-date descriptions of engineering methods to measure, analyze, and design manual work. The text emphasizes both the manual components and the cognitive aspects of work, recognizing the gradual decline of the manufacturing sector and the growth of the service sector. The importance of ergonomics and work design as part of methods engineering emphasizes not only increased productivity, but also to improve worker health and safety, and thus, company bottom-line costs. In the twenty-first century it is essential that the industrial engineer consider both productivity issues and their efforts on the health and safety of the worker. This comprehensive text addresses this need by integrating the traditional elements of motion and time study along with the human factors and ergonomics and safety engineering.",
