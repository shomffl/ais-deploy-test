  "description": "Globalization is the most common overriding characteristic of our time, with societies all over the world struggling to change their educational systems to meet what are perceived to be the needs of globalization. This book provides an insider's account of how the Japanese educational system is trying to meet that challenge while placing the developments in a larger international context. Distinguishing itself from other books in the same genre, this volume (1) brings in the diversity of insiders' reactions concerning globalization reform in education, while placing such actions in the larger international context, and (2) covers a wide span of education (elementary to higher education) and shows how the globalization reforms as a whole are affecting Japanese education. With a focus on insiders' accounts, this book brings in information that is little known outside of Japan. It also links globalization processes in Japanese society, school education and higher education, accounting for similarities and differences across educational levels, providing insight into the multifaceted processes affecting the Japanese education system. Chapters include: From High School Abroad to College in Japan: The Difficulties of the Japanese Returnee Experience The University of Tokyo PEAK Program: Venues into the Challenges Faced by Japanese Universities Why Does Cultural Diversity Matter? Korean Higher Education in Comparative Perspective",
