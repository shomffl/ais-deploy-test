  "description": "The insecurity which irregular migrants face on a daily basis because of the unlawfulness of their residence prompted the European Committee on Migration (CDMG) to assess their situation in Council of Europe member states. The aim of the exercise was to pool and evaluate national experience and to draw up proposals on dealing with irregular migrants and improving cooperation between countries of origin and host countries. Five countries volunteered - Armenia, Germany, Greece, Italy and the Russian Federation - and submitted some aspects of their national policies regarding the situation of irregular migrants for evaluation. After Volume I, which contains a summary of the project and the national reports of Italy and Germany, Volume II looks at the situation of irregular migrants in Armenia, Greece and the Russian Federation.",
