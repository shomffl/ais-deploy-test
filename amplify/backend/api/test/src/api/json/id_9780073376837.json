  "description": "The visual impact of the magazine format will win students over quickly. They’ll love the price. And the fascinating, sometimes hard-to-believe real examples will keep them reading. Baltzan and Phillips approach discusses various business initiatives first and how technology supports those initiatives second. The premise for this unique approach is that business initiatives drive technology choices in a corporation. Therefore, every discussion addresses the business needs first and addresses the technology that supports those needs second. This approach takes the difficult and often intangible MIS concepts, brings them down to the student’s level, and applies them using a hands-on approach to reinforce the concepts. M: Information Systems provides the foundation that will enable students to achieve excellence in business, whether they major in operations management, manufacturing, sales, marketing, etc. M: Information Systems is designed to give students the ability to understand how information technology can be a point of strength in an organization. The story behind M: We have heard over and over again that the modern learner has a completely new and different set of needs from a learning package. These new ‘digital natives’ have developed cognitive thinking patterns that are different from those of earlier generations of students. It’s important that educators recognize these differences in students, and that they also account for students with differing learning styles. Students today rely on technology as an important tool in their educational and personal lives. M: Information Systems accounts for these differences in students today and appeals more effectively to digital natives. An emphasis is placed on the visual and technology component of the product offering (Connect Interactives), while the text remains a (important) supporting tool for their learning in the course. Students today are used to active learning experiences which is what M: Information Systems provides. The book in combination with the Interactives in Connect MIS provide students with a rich, interactive experience that enhances the text content, and keeps them actively engaged in the course content. Students today are also used to feedback and ‘payoff’ - Connect MIS provides these interactive rewards for learning the course content. For instructors opting not to adopt Connect MIS, M: Information Systems will still appeal to this generation of students looking for a quick read and insight that is also entertaining.",
