  "description": "This book offers a unique picture of education and training in the EU between the early 1980s and the late 1990s. It synthesizes a wealth of research, policy documents and original data from the fifteen Member States and from the European Commission. The advent of the Single Market and of the euro have focused attention on economic integration in Europe; while discussions of globalization also emphasize common trends and economic convergence. Convergence and Divergence in European Education and Training Systems demonstrates that, while European education and training systems are responding to powerful general trends, they remain highly distinctive, with no obvious movement towards a single common pattern.",
