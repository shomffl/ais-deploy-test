  "description": "Popular Culture and Globalisation in Japan provides exciting and fascinating insights into Japanese popular culture. It explores the 'Japaneseness' of Japanese popular culture by focusing on the intersection of globalization and popular cultural products associated with Japan. The editors argue that there are many 'insides' and 'outsides', which inform the production and consumption of Japanese popular culture, thus that the 'Japan' in Japanese popular culture is always dislocated, contaminated and criss-crossed. This text is clearly presented through a number of detailed case studies, each written by cross-culturally informed contributors, which propose that understanding popular culture associated with Japan be reassessed within the context of a complex matrix of relations that include multiple power-relations such as race or ethnicity, gender, class, ageism, popularity of popular culture, and the impacts of outside influences on producers and consumers of popular culture. The interdisciplinary nature of this book will appeal to both an academic and popular audience with interests in a variety of fields, and the current theoretically informed research is a welcome addition to Japanese Studies--Publishers blurb.",
