  "description": "Cyberbullying is a problem that is being increasingly investigated by researchers, however, much of the cyberbullying research literature to date has focused on children and youth. Cyberbullying at University in International Contexts fills the gap in the research literature by examining the nature, extent, impacts, proposed solutions, and policy and practice considerations of bullying in the cyber-world at post-secondary institutions, where reports of serious cyberbullying incidents have become more prevalent. This book brings together cutting-edge research from around the world to examine the issue of cyberbullying through a multi-disciplinary lens, offering an array of approaches, interpretations, and solutions. It is not solely focused on cyberbullying by and against students, but also includes cyberbullying by and against faculty members, and permutations involving both students and faculty, as well as institutional staff, presenting perspectives from students, practitioners and senior university policy makers. It draws on research from education, criminology, psychology, sociology, communications, law, health sciences, social work, humanities, labour studies and is valuable reading for graduate students in these fields. It is also essential reading for policymakers, practitioners and University administrators who recognize their responsibility to provide a healthy workplace for their staff, as well as a safe and respectful environment for their students.",
