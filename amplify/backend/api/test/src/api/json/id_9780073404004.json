  "description": "Stuart's Auditing and Assurance Services: An Applied Approach is a concise, easy-to-read auditing text that trains students of today for the business world that they will face tomorrow. Using a fresh approach that introduces auditing application prior to auditing theory, students will encounter auditing in practice first, become more engaged in the subject matter, and consequently feel more readily prepared to understand the more challenging theoretical concepts. Stuart further engages students by highlighting real-world accounting scandals and by including the most up-to-date standards, including international coverage.",
