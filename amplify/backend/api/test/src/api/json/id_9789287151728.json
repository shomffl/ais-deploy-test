  "description": "The social, political and economic transformations experienced by the formerly socialist countries of central and eastern Europe since the beginning of the 1990s have resulted in abrupt shifts in demographic trends, whose consequences on nuptiality, fertility, mortality and migration will be significant and irreversible. The present study analyses and offers explanations about this process and compares these developments with the demographic changes that occurred earlier in western Europe. A thorough knowledge of these demographic trends offers an essential tool for social policy makers and researchers and the comparative approach of the study furthers our understanding of the underlying processes taking place in all European countries",
