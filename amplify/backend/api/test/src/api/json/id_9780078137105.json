Leaders and the Leadership Process 6e provides students with a sense of the complexity associated with leadership in organizations as well as an understanding of the pieces that serve to define leadership. The authors create a \"leadership mosaic,\" which encourages students to examine the concepts, propositions, perspectives, and theories individually as they build towards the student’s ultimate unique leadership mosaic.",
