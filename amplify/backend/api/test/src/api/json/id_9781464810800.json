  "description": "\"The Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals 2017 was produced by the Development Economics Data Group of the World Bank, in collaboration with the Global Practices and Cross-Cutting Solution Areas of the World Bank and the Office of the Senior Vice President for the 2030 Development Agenda, United Nations Relations, and Partnerships.\"--Acknowledgments., The World Bank's compilation of statistics from over 200 economies is built around World Development Indicators (WDI) - selected indicators have been identified and visualized to analyze trends and challenges, and to catalyze discussion on measurement issues. The Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals 2017 uses maps, charts and analysis to illustrate, trends, challenges and measurement issues related to each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Given the breadth and scope of the SDGs, the editors have been selective, emphasizing issues considered important by experts in the World Bank's Global Practices and Cross Cutting Solution Areas. Nevertheless, The Atlas aims to reflect the breadth of the Goals themselves and presents national and regional trends and snapshots of progress towards the UN's seventeen Sustainable Development Goals: poverty, hunger, health, education, gender, water, energy, jobs, infrastructure, inequalities, cities, consumption, climate, oceans, the environment, peace, institutions, and partnerships. Between 1990 and 2013, nearly one billion people were raised out of extreme poverty. Its elimination is now a realistic prospect, although this will require both sustained growth and reduced inequality. Even then, gender inequalities continue to hold back human potential",
