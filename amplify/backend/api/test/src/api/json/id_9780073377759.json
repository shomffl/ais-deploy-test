  "description": "Managerial Communication, 5e by Geraldine Hynes focuses on skills and strategies that managers need in today’s workplace. This book continues to stand out in the field for its strategic approach, solid research base, comprehensive range of topics, even-handed examination of oral and written channels, and focus on managerial, not entry-level, competencies. The overriding principle for the revision was to preserve the book’s key strengths while reflecting the realities of the twenty-first century workplace. The chapters have been streamlined and condensed to meet the needs of a busy contemporary manager and content has been added to reflect current business practices.",
