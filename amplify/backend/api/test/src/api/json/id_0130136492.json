  "description": "For courses in the Historical Foundations of Education. The History of American Education: A Great American Experiment offers a critical analysis of the history of American education by constantly asking readers to analyze and reflect on their own beliefs and educational experiences throughout their reading. This text uses the availability of new historical sources and new interpretive methodologies to encourage students to actively think about history, recognize alternative interpretations of historic information, and understand how the educational system has evolved in the United States over time., Cultural Foundations of Education is designed to provide a foundation for thinking about curricula and pedagogy. The authors believe that educators must be equipped with the knowledge and understanding necessary for effective analysis of educational issues. The foundation of the new edition is that this book will contribute to more thoughtful dialogue about education in its cultural context. A number of significant changes have been incorporated into the fourth edition, including chapter-opening vignettes, concepts of \"private\" and \"operating\" cultures and syncretism, and a discussion of the role of history in understanding cultural foundations of education.",
