  "description": "This publication is the second volume of a report which discusses the changing age structure in European countries, characterised by the increase in the number of elderly persons and the decrease in the young and working populations. It focuses on the demographic characteristics of people aged 80 years and over, the fastest growing age group within the population, including existing living arrangements, health issues, gender and socio-economic characteristics., This study investigates the demographic characteristics of the \"oldest old\" (people aged 80 and more). The European Population Committee of the Council of Europe decided to undertake this research, given that it is the fastest growing age group within the population and there is an increased realization that the group has different needs and is different socially, economically and physically from the \"younger old\" (ages 60 - 79). The report describes changing age and sex structure, existing living arrangements and some of the socio-economic characteristics of this population group. It provides valuable material for policymakers since the subject is closely linked to issues such as rising health care costs, community care, and provisions for institutionalised housing.",
