  "description": "Hartman/DesJardins is designed to prepare the student to apply an ethical decision-making model, not only in this ethics course but throughout her or his business discipline. This model teaches students ethical skills, vocabulary, and tools to apply in everyday business decisions and throughout their business courses. The authors speak in a sophisticated yet accessible manner while teaching the fundamentals of business ethics. Hartman’s professional background in law and her teaching experience in the business curriculum, combined with DesJardins’ background in philosophy, results in a broad language, ideal for this approach and market. The authors’ goal is to engage the student by focusing on cases and business scenarios that students already find interesting. Students are then asked to look at the issues from an ethical perspective. Additionally, its focus on AACSB requirements makes it a comprehensive business ethics text for business school courses. The goal for the second edition remains the same as for the first: to provide “a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to the ethical issues arising in business.” Hartman and DesJardins have retained the focus on decision-making as well as the emphasis on both personal and policy-level perspectives on ethics. This edition continues to provide pedagogical support throughout the text. The most noticeable changes involve a thorough updating of distinct items such as Reality Checks, Decision Points, and readings to reflect new cases, examples and data.",
