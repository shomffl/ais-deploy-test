  "description": "The overriding philosophy of this text is that the ethical obligations of accountants and auditors are best understood in the context of professional responsibilities including one’s role in the corporate governance system, the requirements of financial reporting, the audit function, obligations to prevent and detect fraud, and legal liabilities. Ethical Obligations and Decision Making in Accounting was written to guide accountants past a scandal filled age. Our book is entirely devoted to helping students cultivate the ethical commitment needed to ensure that their work meets the highest standards of integrity, independence, and objectivity. Ethical Obligations and Decision Making in Accounting is designed to provide the instructor with the best flexibility and pedagogical effectiveness of any book on the market. To that end, it includes numerous features designed to make both learning and teaching easier.",
