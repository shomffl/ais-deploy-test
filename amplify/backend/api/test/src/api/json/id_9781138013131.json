  "description": "\"This book applies the concept of human security to the specific case of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident that struck Japan on 11 March 2011, which has come to be known as Japan's 'triple disaster'. This left more than 15,000 people dead, displaced more than 300,000, and was the most expensive natural disaster in recorded history. This volume illustrates the different forms of human insecurity that appeared and were exacerbated, as well as more encouraging signs of human empowerment and reform that have also occurred. The book develops the human security approach not only through extending it to natural disasters, but also by demonstrating how it can be developed by adopting an interdisciplinary perspective\"--",
