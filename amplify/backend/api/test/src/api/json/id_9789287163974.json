  "description": "The insecurity which irregular migrants face on a daily basis because of the unlawfulness of their residence prompted the European Committee on Migration (CDMG) to assess their situation in Council of Europe member states. The aim of the exercise was to pool national experiences and evaluate them and also to draw up possible proposals on dealing with irregular migrants and improving co-operation between countries of origin and host countries. Five countries volunteered (Armenia, Germany, Greece, Italy and the Russian Federation) and submitted some aspects of their national policies on the situation of irregular migrants for evaluation.The first volume contains a summary chapter (objectives, methodology, lessons to be drawn, etc) and the national reports of Italy and Germany.",
