  "description": "The National Incident Management System (NIMS) Incident Command System (ICS) Forms Booklet, FEMA 502-2, is designed to assist emergency response personnel in the use of ICS and corresponding documentation during incident operations. This booklet is a companion document to the NIMS ICS Field Operations Guide (FOG), FEMA 502-1, which provides general guidance to emergency responders on implementing ICS. This booklet is meant to complement existing incident management programs and does not replace relevant emergency operations plans, laws, and ordinances. These forms are designed for use within the Incident Command System, and are not targeted for use in Area Command or in multiagency coordination systems. These forms are intended for use as tools for the creation of Incident Action Plans (IAPs), for other incident management activities, and for support and documentation of ICS activities. Personnel using the forms should have a basic understanding of NIMS, including ICS, through training and/or experience to ensure they can effectively use and understand these forms. These ICS Forms represent an all-hazards approach and update to previously used ICS Forms. While the layout and specific blocks may have been updated, the functionality of the forms remains the same. It is recommended that all users familiarize themselves with the updated forms and instructions. These forms are designed to include the essential data elements for the ICS process they address. The use of these standardized ICS Forms is encouraged to promote consistency in the management and documentation of incidents in the spirit of NIMS, and to facilitate effective use of mutual aid. In many cases, additional pages can be added to the existing ICS Forms when needed, and several forms are set up with this specific provision.",
