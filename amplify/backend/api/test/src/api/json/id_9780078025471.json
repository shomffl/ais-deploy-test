  "description": "This book is designed to not only expose beginning tax students to tax law, but to also teach the practical intricacies involved in preparation of a tax return. Emphasizing a hands-on approach to tax education, every concept introduced in the text includes meaningful exercises that allow students to reinforce what they are learning. Actual tax forms are included within the text, with real-world data inserted into actual tax forms to demonstrate applied skills. A copy of the individual tax return preparation software TaxACT is also a part of the text package, providing yet another tool to bridge the gap between understanding and practical application of tax law.",
