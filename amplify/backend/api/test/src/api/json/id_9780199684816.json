  "description": "The growth and development fields have expanded in the last twelve years in welcome directions that aim to deepen our understanding of the fundamental determinants of comparative development. This new book evaluates these new directions, including developments in endogenous growth theory and economic geography as well as the rise and challenge of the new institutional economics, in the light of the earlier, classical contributions to developmenttheory.The professional economist and researcher will find in the present book original theses on the contributions that early development theory can make to the research program of the economics of growth and comparative development. Graduate and advanced undergraduate students in economics willfind a balanced theoretical treatment and an assessment of the empirical evidence provided by new and earlier approaches to economic growth and development.",
