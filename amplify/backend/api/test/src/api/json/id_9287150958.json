  "description": "This report examines the demographic factors likely to have an impact on social exclusion and poverty, including the patterns of young adults leaving the parental home; family household dynamics; cohabitation and separation; reproductive behaviour, and morbidity. It is based on the international study into the complex relationship between demography and social exclusion. Issues considered include: concepts, data and methodology; social disadvantage and the elderly, one-person and one-parent households; and groups most at risk, such as children in poverty, immigrants experiencing deprivation, and the homeless.",
