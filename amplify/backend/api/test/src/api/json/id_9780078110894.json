  "description": "Course Overview: Fundamental Managerial Accounting Concepts 6th edition is intended for the managerial accounting course taken primarily by sophomores at both two and four year schools. Adopters of Edmonds’ Fundamental Financial Accounting Concepts may be interested in this text for their managerial courses. This book is also a fit for schools moving away from Principles of Accounting texts to splits and/or schools that find their current text to be too encyclopedic and would like a text integrating a more user-oriented perspective. Title Overview: Fundamental Managerial Accounting Concepts 6th edition by Edmonds/Edmonds/Tsay/Olds focuses on concepts that are isolated and introduced in a logical sequence. The authors intentionally limit the scope of the material to help students build a solid foundation of the most important concepts in managerial accounting. Fundamental Managerial Accounting Concepts 6th edition is organized in a distinctive way, particularly in the first six chapters. The objective is to establish a coherent, integrative framework that enables students to build knowledge in stepwise fashion. The authors’ goal is for students to understand the underlying principles of accounting, not just memorize content.",
