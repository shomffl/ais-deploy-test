  "description": "Many principles of management textbooks make the assumption that students already have a stable understanding of the subject. Management Now combines the theory students need with examples within their grasp as well as provides reinforcing exercises and activities to help them retain and apply what they have learned. The emphasis is on application of material with a variety of exercises—both hypothetical and real life—for students to review and apply in their own environments. The text and ancillary materials help address the question that many students ask when taking a principles of management course: \"What does management mean to me?\"",
