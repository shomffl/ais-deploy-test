  "description": "Issues in Economics Today is a modern issues book built to meet instructor and student needs simultaneously. This title was developed to allow instructors the maximum flexibility to teach this material in a manner that fits their personal style. This edition includes 8 intensive core theory chapters and 35 shorter issues chapters. The book is designed to allow faculty the flexibility in approach, whether they prefer weave together theory and issues or lay a foundation of theory first before heading into the issues. With flexibility in mind, instructors can set a theme for their course and pick issues consistent with that theme or their students decide what issues interest them.",
