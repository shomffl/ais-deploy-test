With this text, students gain a well-balanced appreciation of the Accounting profession. As Hoyle 10e introduces them to the field’s many aspects, it often focuses on past controversies and present resolutions. The text continues to show the development of financial reporting as a product of intense and considered debate that continues today and into the future. The writing style of the nine previous editions has been highly praised. Students easily comprehend chapter concepts because of the conversational tone used throughout the book. The authors have made every effort to ensure that the writing style remains engaging, lively, and consistent which has made this text the market leading text in the Advanced Accounting market. The Tenth Edition includes an increase integration of IFRS as well as the updated accounting standards.",
