  "description": "This publication is the second volume of a report which examines the reproductive health behaviour of young people in Europe, focusing on the role of health education and promotion strategies in influencing reproductive behaviour. It includes case studies from the UK, Bulgaria, Finland and the Russian Federation., This publication is the first volume of a report which examines the reproductive health behaviour of young people in Europe. It focuses on contraceptive practices and the use of abortion amongst young adults, and trends in teenage sexual behaviour in terms of pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV infections. These discussions provide a background for research into the possible impact of legislation and government policy on the role of the welfare system, the institutional framework of reproductive health services and education., This is the second volume of a report that examines the reproductive health behaviour of young Europeans. While the first publication (Population studies No.42) focused on contraceptive practices and sexual and reproductive behaviour, this report studies the role of education and information, explaining how health promotion by institutions and programmes can influence reproductive health. The author argues that reproductive health can be promoted effectively through national reproductive health strategies, provided there is an adequate provision of sexual and reproductive health infrastructure.",
