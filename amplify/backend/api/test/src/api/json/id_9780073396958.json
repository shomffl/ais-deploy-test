  "description": "Overview: The Haddock text features the successful author team Price et al. The author team based A Contemporary Approach on the solid foundation of the Price 12e textbook; however, in Haddock, the approach has been modified to fit the needs of a growing number of College Accounting instructors who teach the course without covering special journals. These instructors feel that special journals are an unnecessarily complicated subject for such a basic course. By eliminating special journal coverage, professors are free to focus on recording to the general journal and posting to the general ledger - the basic bookkeeping functions that are so important to accountants in the real world. Competing books have placed special journals in an appendix (Slater) or tried to separate special journal coverage from general journal coverage but retain both (McQuaig). Haddock is the only text on the market that eliminates special journal coverage completely (why make students pay for material they will not learn in the course?). With Haddock on the roster, instructor’s have a choice between a traditional approach that fully integrates special journals into the text in a succinct and logical way (Price 12e) or a contemporary approach that focuses on the basics and is more in keeping with where the course is headed in the future (Haddock 1e).",
