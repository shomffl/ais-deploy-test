  "description": "Foundations of Financial Management is a proven and successful text recognized for its excellent writing style and step-by-step explanations to make the content relevant and easy to understand. The text's approach focuses on the \"nuts and bolts\" of finance with clear and thorough treatment of concepts and applications. There is a strong real-world emphasis presented throughout. This text has definitely stood the test of time due to the authors' time, energy, and commitment to quality revisions. In addition to completing the textbook revisions, the authors also revised ALL end of chapter problems and complete the solutions themselves. Block/Hirt/Danielson know what works and what doesn't work for students, and they have consistently maintained a high quality textbook that is responsive to the demands of the marketplace.",
