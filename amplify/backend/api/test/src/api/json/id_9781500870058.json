  "description": "What High School Didn't Teach Me is a recent graduate’s perspective on how high school is killing creativity by forcing students to memorize factoids, rather than inspiring them to pursue creative endeavors and teaching them how to problem solve. The author—Rajat Bhageria—describes how too many high school students today focus all of their efforts on maintaining high grades, rather than on developing intrinsic motivation for their passions. Bhageria addresses many major subjects in education reform: English, social studies, mathematics, sciences, research/engineering, entrepreneurship, computer science, liberal arts, the college process. Additionally he proposes a full revamp of the high school experience.",
