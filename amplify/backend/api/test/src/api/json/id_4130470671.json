  "description": "\"Both during and after the Cold War, the United States has played an essential role in Japan's marketization, not only by providing stable conditions for growth but also by serving as a model for democratizationa and privatization of markets. The contributors to this volume describe the marketization of Japan's economy in such areas as government and corporate investment, health care and pensions, labour policy and securities markets. They point out how Japan has adapted and transformed the \"pure market logic\" of U.S. capitalism into forms more suited to Japan's history and traditions.\" -- BOOK JACKET.",
