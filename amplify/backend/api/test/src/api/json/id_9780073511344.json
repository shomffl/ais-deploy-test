  "description": "Appleyard, Field, and Cobb’s International Economics 7e text is an International Economics textbook that offers a consistent level of analysis and treatment of the two main subdivisions of international economics—international trade theory and policy and international monetary theory and policy. As the authors write this edition, the world has become painfully aware that increased globalization links countries together strongly in times both of recession and prosperity. The growing awareness of the importance of international issues is also evidenced in increased student interest in such issues, particularly those related to employment, international working conditions, and equity. Comprehensive and clear, International Economics helps students move beyond recognition toward an understanding of current and future international events. As with each prior edition, the authors provide a clear and comprehensive text that will help students move beyond simple recognition of international issues toward a level of understanding of current and future international developments that will be of use to them in analyzing the problem at hand and selecting a policy position. New improvements covering the emerging issues in the global economy are designed to help readers both understand and appreciate the growing importance of the global economy in their lives.",
